\section*{Dear Oven,}
\vspace{0.5em} % HACCCCK
I wanna lead with something I think Oven/Bun could do, you are working on changing the JavaScript game afterall.
\\\\
Bun could stand out even further by having the best-in-class JavaScript debugging experience.
I think the JavaScript ecosystem is badly missing a scriptable (terminal) debugger... you have
the position to bring it.
\\\\
Imagine, being able to reliably dodge irrelevant caught exceptions while chasing a caught swallowed exception,
by adding a tiny script to your exception breakpoint that checks the stack/exception context and
decides whether to continue or break?
I think bun could provide an experience like [c]gdb, that developers love.
\\\\
And I'm sure much more is possible, including not just using this from a terminal.
\\\\
I wanted to mention at least this, because I don't mind giving away the idea.
But, I don't expect to be considered for hiring even though I am currently job searching, because
I don't intend to move to California for at least a year
(I literally just moved to the Manhattan area).
\\\\
But feel free to reach out!
\\\\
