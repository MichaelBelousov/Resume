\section*{Experience}

    \textsc{Bentley Systems},
    \textit{Software Engineer}\\
    June 2019---Current\\
        \bul Developed multiple full stack applications with Node.js, React.js, C++, ASP.NET C\#, C++, SQL[ite].
        \\
        \bul Maintained, and helped modernize, core C++ libraries and custom data persistence technology.
        \\
        \bul Wrote the Unreal Engine Datasmith integration for the iTwin platform.
        \\
        \bul Wrote several public and internal, technical and beginner, articles about using our open-source
        software, on the \href{https://medium.com/itwinjs/community/home}{iTwin developer community blog}, such as
\href{https://medium.com/itwinjs/introducing-bentley-imodel-react-hooks-8945a72711d2}{``Introducing \texttt{@bentley/imodel-react-hooks}''} and

        \\
        \bul Increased developer productivity in several ways including: setting up CI/CD (Azure Piplines and Github Actions) for new and old projects, profiling and tuning build tools like Webpack (3$\times$ speed increase in our case) and wrote custom tooling (ESLint rules) to prevent entire bug classes.
        \\
        \bul Contributed to open source projects that we used, such as \href{https://github.com/okonet/lint-staged}{\texttt{lint-staged}}, and \href{https://github.com/typescript-eslint/typescript-eslint}{\texttt{typescript-eslint}}.
